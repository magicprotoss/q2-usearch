    abstract = "{Motivation: Biological sequence data is accumulating rapidly, motivating the development of improved high-throughput methods for sequence classification.Results: UBLAST and USEARCH are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. They are often orders of magnitude faster than BLAST in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. UCLUST is a new clustering method that exploits USEARCH to assign sequences to clusters. UCLUST offers several advantages over the widely used program CD-HIT, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.Availability: Binaries are available at no charge for non-commercial use at http://www.drive5.com/usearchContact:  robert@drive5.comSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Motivation: Next-generation sequencing produces vast amounts of data with errors that are difficult to distinguish from true biological variation when coverage is low.Results: We demonstrate large reductions in error frequencies, especially for high-error-rate reads, by three independent means: (i) filtering reads according to their expected number of errors, (ii) assembling overlapping read pairs and (iii) for amplicon reads, by exploiting unique sequence abundances to perform error correction. We also show that most published paired read assemblers calculate incorrect posterior quality scores.Availability and implementation: These methods are implemented in the USEARCH package.
